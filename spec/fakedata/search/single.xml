    <synopsis>After a mysterious inferno kills his family, Shirou is saved and adopted by Kiritsugu Emiya, who teaches him the ways of magic and justice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One night, years after Kiritsugu&amp;#039;s death, Shirou is cleaning at school, when he finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly encounter between two superhumans known as Servants. During his attempt to escape, the boy is caught by one of the Servants and receives a life-threatening injury. Miraculously, he survives, but the same Servant returns to finish what he started. In desperation, Shirou summons a Servant of his own, a knight named Saber. The two must now participate in the Fifth Holy Grail War, a battle royale of seven Servants and the mages who summoned them, with the grand prize being none other than the omnipotent Holy Grail itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[i]Fate/stay night[/i] follows Shirou as he struggles to find the fine line between a hero and a killer, his ideals clashing with the harsh reality around him. Will the boy become a hero like his foster father, or die trying?&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. In spite of that, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated &amp;quot;Magus Killer&amp;quot; Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of Kiritsugu.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the light novel written by Gen Urobuchi, [i]Fate/Zero[/i] depicts the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War&amp;mdash;10 years prior to [i]Fate/stay night[/i]. Witness a battle royale in which no one is guaranteed to survive.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>As the Fourth Holy Grail War rages on with no clear victor in sight, the remaining Servants and their Masters are called upon by Church supervisor Risei Kotomine, in order to band together and confront an impending threat that could unravel the Grail War and bring about the destruction of Fuyuki City. The uneasy truce soon collapses as Masters demonstrate that they will do anything in their power, no matter how despicable, to win.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seeds of doubt are sown between Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber, his Servant, as their conflicting ideologies on heroism and chivalry clash. Meanwhile, an ominous bond forms between Kirei Kotomine, who still seeks to find his purpose in life, and one of the remaining Servants. As the countdown to the end of the war reaches zero, the cost of winning begins to blur the line between victory and defeat.&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>Tatsuko of class 5-1 is really excited about the upcoming school sports festival, her proposal for a new &amp;quot;Eel Scooping&amp;quot; event is less than enthusiastically received though, especially by Suzuka. Illya mentions the main event dance to Miyu, and as teacher Taiga Fujimura points out, it entails a huge reward, but will require quite a bit of practice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so the close friends: sarcastic Nanaki, level-headed Suzuka, excitable Tatsuko, energetic Illya, shy Mimi, and reserved but athletic Miyu are off to win the dance event for the honour of their class and for Fujimura, who seems to have some saucy bet going on that she most definitely needs to win, or so the girls misunderstand.&lt;br /&gt;

To realize the mythical Holy Grail, which is said to grant any wish from its possessor, seven masters are given seven heroic spirits chosen by the Grail. These heroic spirits or servants are: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin, Berserker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each master will enter into a contract with their assigned servants and battle the other masters and servants to the death until only one pair remains...&lt;br /&gt;

With the witch growing ever more powerful, Rin and Archer determine she is a threat that must be dealt with at once. But as the balance of power in the war begins to shift, the Master and Servant find themselves walking separate ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, despite losing his Servant and stumbling from injuries, Shirou ignores Rin&amp;#039;s warning to abandon the battle royale, forcing his way into the fight against Caster. Determined to show his resolve in his will to fight, Shirou&amp;#039;s potential to become a protector of the people is put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amidst the bloodshed and chaos, the motivations of each Master and Servant are slowly revealed as they sacrifice everything in order to arise as the victor and claim the Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;
